# 100x Week 3 â€” Virtual Try-On (VTON) with ComfyUI

**Assignment (Medium Level):** Create a **Virtual Try-On Workflow** in ComfyUI where you provide a **model image** and a **garment image**, and generate a realistic output of the model wearing that clothing.  

This is where **AI meets fashion** â€” no fitting rooms, just prompt-powered design.

## âœ¨ Workflow Overview
The workflow combines:
- **Masking** â†’ Segments the person from the background.  
- **IPAdapter** â†’ Transfers garment style and texture.  
- **Depth ControlNet** â†’ Maintains realistic body structure, folds, and fit.  

The result: seamless, **AI-powered try-on images** that look natural and stylish.
